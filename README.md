# Pytorch-Adaptive-Instance-Normalization

A Pytorch implementation of the 2017 Huang et. al. paper "Arbitrary Style Transfer in Real-time with Adaptive Instance Normalization" [https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06868](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06868)
Written from scratch with essentially no reference to Xun Huangs implementation in lua/torch (can be found here: [https://github.com/xunhuang1995/AdaIN-style](https://github.com/xunhuang1995/AdaIN-style)) but I'm none the less incredbily greatful to Huang et. al. for writing such an outstandingly beautiful paper and making their method so clear and easy to implement!
